Have mysem_t struct.
The struct have:
    the semaphore id
    the semaphore number    
    the semaphore is up or down
    the semaphore is initialized or not

In init:
    Check if the n is right valid
    if not return 0

    Check if the semaphore is initialized
    if yes return 0

    Initialize the semaphore
    Write to the struct is incremented and  return 1

In down:
    Check if the semaphore is initialized
    if not return -1

    Make the union semaphore down

    Decrement the semaphore
    Write to the struct is decremented and return 1

In up:
    Check if the semaphore is initialized
    if not return -1

    Check the semaphore is up
    if yes return 0

    Make the union semaphore up

    Increment the semaphore
    Write to the struct is incremented and return 1

In destroy:
    Check if the semaphore is initialized
    if not return -1

    Destroy the semaphore
    If the struct is destroyed return 1
